# EyeMovementExercise
In this excerise we used the DOM elements to change the position of "eyes" we used. This activity shows that you can use a users inputs to have different actions. We also looked into how to use styling to change how differents elements looked.
To use this Program simply press the mouse anywhere on the screen, then move your cursor around the screen. You will notice that the eyes will follow your movements until you move the cursor off the screen.
Some future improvements to be made could possibly include features like blinking eyelids with mouse clicks, color changing pupils the faster you move your cursor, and faster refresh rate on the loop to smooth the movement of the eyes.
